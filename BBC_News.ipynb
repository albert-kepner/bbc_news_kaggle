We want take advantage of information in both sets of documents to predict which news categories apply to the test documents. Since NMF is an unsupervised method which does not depend on training labels to infer categories, I think we will get a better model by using all the available data in the combined corpus of training and test documents.\n",

    "We will be using <b>TF-IDF</b> or Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency as a way to encode features from the collections of words in each document. The <b>corpus</b> is the set of all words appearing in all documents being considered. A <b>term</b> is a word that appears in the corpus, or a short sequence of specific words. When sequences of words are considered they are called  <b>n-grams</b>. The NGRAM_RANGE defines the minimum and maximum length of the sequences considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ti=f-idf value is proportial to the number of times a term is used in each specific document, and is weighted lower for terms that appear frequently in many documents in the corpus. Terms that appear frequently in given documents may be strong indications of the topics in the document, but terms that appear frequently across many documement provide little specific information.\n",

    "The scikit-learn TfidfVectorizer determines the frequency of all the terms in the corpus across all documents and across\n",

    "# Step 2: Building and training BBC News NMF models -- Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The NMF model built so far in this notebook uses a TfidfVectorizer with the top 5000 term features, and using N_GRAMS of length 1 and 2. The document versus term weight matrix was then factored using the NMF algorithm, and targeting 5 topics. By inspecting the most frequent terms in each of the 5 topics, we identified which topic in the matracies corresponds with each of the 5 BBC News categories. Then by examining the matrix <b>document_weights</b> (dimension 5 topics by #documents) we were able to predict which topic goes with each document just by finding the highest topic weight per document.\n",

    "Initially this produced an accuracy of 0.92081 on the training documents and a Kaggle accuracy score of 0.92925 on the test documents.\n",

    "To improve this model I tried increasing the MAX_FEATURES used in the TfidfVectorizer and at the same time increasing the length of the N_GRAMS used as terms in the model. The results are shown in the following table:"

    "I noted that in the Movie Ratings matrix (dimensions 6040 users by 3883 movies) that missing values (movies not rated by a given user) were represented as 0, with ratings in the range 1 to 5. Also about 97% of the ratings were missing, so that on average each user had rated about 3% of the movies. Rather than using this matrix directly, I imputed all the zero values as the average movie rating for each given user and then applied NMF factorization to the resulting matrix, assumming we wanted 18 features to represent the 18 movie genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the factored matrices I had a 6040 by 18 matrix representing weight each user placed on each genre and an 18 by 3883 matrix representing the relative weight of each genre in each movie. I then predicted the rating of each user for each move in the test data set by taking the dot product of the user's row in the first matrix by the movie's column in the 2nd matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suprisingly this prediction produced an RSME of 0.9695, which was almost as good as the best collaborative model. However the NMF based prediction would have been much worse had I used the movie ratings matrix directly with all the zero values for missing data."
